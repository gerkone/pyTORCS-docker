  penalties for corner cutting etc. (Bernhard).
- During repair pit stops accumulated penalty time is added to pit stop and then cleared
  (Bernhard).
- Stop&Go and drive-through penalties pending at the end of the race are now transformed
  into a time penalty, see comment in raceresults.cpp, ReApplyRaceTimePenalties (Bernhard).

- Changed wheels shininess to 1 (from 128) to fix some ugly rendering seen on some videos,
  not reproducable here (Bernhard).
- Fixed a problem regarding SimReConfig spring adjustments discovered by Wolf-Dieter
  (spring values were inverted for special case when parameter was not adjustable, 
  min == max) (Wolf-Dieter, Bernhard).
- Added absolute value of speed vector, accessible in tCarElt->pub.speed, use it in
  aero.cpp, grsmoke.cpp, grskidmarks.cpp, CarSoundData.cpp and human.cpp (David,
  Bernhard).

- Implemented corner cutting penalty for races, the penalty is currently calculated
  as speed*timestep*deviation/minlegalradius, see raceengine.cpp (Bernhard).
- Best lap time committing is in races now handled like in qualifying and practice,
  so if you cut corners or hit walls the lap cannot be a best lap (Bernhard).
- Penalty time is displayed in top left panels (Bernhard).

  Bernhard).
- Removed custom starting grid for e-track-2 (Bernhard).
- Added e-track-2 to championship (Bernhard).

  options (Bernhard).
- Changed version to 1.3.6 (Bernhard).
- Added pit stop time configuration options for race sections in racemanager xml,
  see raceman.h and racemain.cpp, ReInitRules. Refuel fuel flow, repair time factor,
