	<h1>I want to drive!</h1>
	
	<p>
		Here is the manual for the players who want to drive in TORCS <b>1.3.0</b>.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		First of all you should install and run TORCS, for that see the
		<a href="http://torcs.org/sections.php?op=viewarticle&artid=3">installation manual</a>.
		After that you can drive a car with a joystick or a steering wheel, or the mouse or keyboard.
		To configure the player, go to the Player's Configuration menu.

	</p>
	
	<p>
		To select a player to configure, click in the "Players" zone on a player's name 
		or on "--- empty ---" if you want to create a new player. To delete a player, select it
		then use the "delete" button.
	</p>

	</p>
	
	<p>
		Here we have selected the player named "Player". In order to change its name,
		click in the "name" field and edit it. If you do not want to come back later to change
		the car create multiple players with different cars, this can safe quite some time.

	<p>
		<img src="images/torcs-7.jpg">
	</p>
	
	<p>
		And press the key you want to use to that control, or even move the mouse to use
		the mouse to control the car
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<img src="images/torcs-8.jpg">
	</p>
	
	<p>
		If your joystick is configured, you can also move the joystick to use it for that control.
		See <a href="http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~vojtech/joystick/">the Vojtech Pavlik's joystick
		driver site</a> for more information on how you can have your joystick work under Linux.
		(see also <a href="http://www.icculus.org/lgfaq">Linux Gamers FAQ</a>).
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<img src="images/torcs-9.jpg">
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Proceed with all the controls you want to configure (you can also use joystick buttons),
		and calibrate the joystick. Beware, before you enter the calibration screen the axis
		should be centred.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<img src="images/torcs-10.jpg">
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Then follow the calibration instructions
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<img src="images/torcs-11.jpg">
	</p>
	
	<p>
		When the calibration is done, press the "back" button. If something went wrong
		during the calibration process, don't panic, use the "reset" button to start over
		the calibration.

	<p>
		The display configuration is done in the "Display" menu
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<img src="images/torcs-23.jpg">
	</p>
	
	<p>
		You can adjust the screen resolution, the colour depth and the display mode
		(windowed or fullscreen) then apply to validate the modifications. <b>Note:</b> If the program
		does not start with the parameters you have chosen, don't panic, you just edit the
		"config/screen.xml" file and reset the values to a more conservative choice.
	</p>

		If you are experiencing problems with the mouse cursor, you can try to launch TORCS with the option "-m".
		And if you have texture problems, you can try the "-s" option to run in single texture mode.
