        <h1>TORCS Robot Tutorial</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The goal of this tutorial is to motivate you to write your own TORCS robot and to guide you through
          the first steps. So what does the term "robot" here mean exactly? A robot is a program that drives
          a car (technically it's a function encapsulated into a shared object in Linux, into a DLL in Windows).
          It is executed from TORCS and gets as input information about the current status of its car and
          the situation on the track. Based on this it can compute how much it wants to steer, to brake or accelerate,
          which gear it needs and if it wants to pit. Your robot returns the data to TORCS and the next
          simulation step will be performed.<br/>
          For me it's great fun to develop my robot, because I can implement my ideas and check it in the
          simulation. I can just say, it didn't really often happen what I expected, because it is a more
          complex and interesting environment as it seems on the first glimpse. You don't have just to fight
          with the control of your car, you have also to avoid collisions, to overtake and to resolve other
          situations.<br/>
          So, if you like to watch races on TV here is something more exciting for you, you can let your
          driver enter the race and participate yourself. Take your chance and enter the race!
        </p>

        <h2>Requirements</h2>
        <p>
          You need to have TORCS installed exactly according to the
          <a href="javascript:changetwoframes('../install/navigation/navigation.html','navigation','../install/install.html','content')">installation</a>
          section (if you have not read the installation instructions, then do it before you start,
		  even if TORCS runs perfectly). It helps if you already
          know a programming language and a bit about data structures like linked lists. You have to write
          your robot in C or C++, but that's easy if you already know another programming language, because you just
          need very easy stuff like basic data types, structures, pointers, arrays and functions. So if
          you are not familiar with C or C++, simply read further and look up a C or C++ tutorial on demand.
          You can find such tutorials on the internet, pick one that fits your needs.
        </p>

        <h2>Resources</h2>
        <p>
          There is a reference manual and much more on the official <a href="http://torcs.org" target="_parent">TORCS site</a>.
          Let us know about your robot and make it available, so that the world can enjoy your work. If you want
          discuss about TORCS, mail to the <a href="mailto:torcs-users@lists.sourceforge.net">torcs-users</a>
          mailing list.
        </p>
