        <h1>5.1 What is a Car Setup</h1>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
		  Racing cars have a lot of parameters one can change. For example you can change
		  the angle of attack of the spoilers, the gears in the gearbox, the stiffness of the
		  springs and many more. A car setup is simply a set of such parameters. Our task is
		  to find an optimal car setup for a given goal. This is a very hard problem, because
		  the parameters are not independent. In fact it's almost impossible to find the
		  optimal setup. Why that? You can imagine all possible setups as n dimensional function
		  (with n the number of parameters) which computes the lap time. We want to find the
		  minimal lap time, so we have to minimize this function. Because this function has
		  (at least!) around 10 dimensions it's almost impossible to find the global minimum. What you can
		  get is a local minimum, which can be much worse than the optimal (global) one.      
		</p>
		
        <h3>Qualifying Setup</h3>
        <p>
		  In the qualifying the goal is to get the minimal lap time. Because there are no other
		  opponents on the track we can drive at the limit. We also just need fuel for a few laps.
		  The top speed on straights doesn't matter as long we reach the minimal lap time.
		</p>

		<h3>Racing Setup</h3>
		<p>
		  The racing setup is a bit different. Of course you still would like to minimize the lap
		  time, but other things become also important. For example it is much easier to overtake
		  on a straight than in a turn, so you want to optimize the setup also for top speed on 
		  a straight, 
		  altough it probably will increase the lap time. The car needs also to be more stable,
		  so that it doesn't spin of the track when it tries to overtake or to avoid a collision.
		  Keep in mind if you want to win a race you have to reach at least the finish line...
		</p>
		
		<h3>Skill Level</h3>
		<p>
		  There are four skill levels available, namely rookie, amateur, semi-pro, and pro.
		  On rookie you have a lot of adherence and no damages, with pro you get a lot of
		  damage and less adherence. I mention that here, because this affects the setups. The
		  default skill level is semi-pro. You can configure it for every car individually
		  in the <span style="color:red;">bt</span>.xml file. Add the skill level line in the
		  section of the car you want to configure, e. g. for the car with index 0:
		</p>
		          
		<p>
		  <pre class="lbcolor">    &lt;section name="0"&gt;
        &lt;attstr name="skill level" val="semi-pro"/&gt;
    &lt;/section&gt;</pre>
		</p>
