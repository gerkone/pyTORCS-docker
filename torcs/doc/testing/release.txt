This thing acts a reminder and check list for me before I pull a release.
Feel free to add other tests, even if they currently fail.

General:
--------

- valgrind runs (to get module symbol information comment out the dlclose in
  linuxspec.cpp, look for the valgrind comment, and build a debug version).
  Currently you need to disable the sound for valgrind runs.

- run a race and check if the memory size stays constant after the start (run
  in a window and top in a console on Linux, the task manager in Windows).
  Use different camera perspectives and look at various cars, is the mem
  footprint stable?


Physics:
--------

- Differentials:
    - Check free, limited slip and spool, park car such that one driven
      wheel is on a loose surface and one on a rigid one (sand/asphalt).
    - Doughnut: clkdtm, pro mode, ASR off, apply full throttle and steer.

- Does stopping on a slope work, check sideways, rear and front uphill,
  rear and front downhill.

- Collisions:
    - Does colliding with pit wall work, test all sort of crashes, forward,
      reverse, in reverse track direction, all 4 sides of the wall.
    - Scratch along the barriers on every track at least one full lap, both
      sides.
    - Check Car-Car and Car-Car-Wall collisions, prepare a stillstanding dummy
      bot for this test, take a rookie car and set the dummy as well to rookie.
      First hit the car and check if the behaviour is acceptable from all
      directions, speeds, reverse and forward. Then push the car onto a wall/
      barrier (check both) such that the dummy is in the sandwich of your car
      and the wall, is the collision reasonable and stable?


Graphics:
---------

Sound:
------

- Does disabling the sound work?

- Does the OpenAL backend work?

- Does the Plib backend work?

- Effects:
    - Engine with Doppler effect.
    - Gear switching "clunk" sound (which one to test?).
    - Air at high speeds, good audible with open wheel car.
    - Engine backfire on some cars, good audible with porsche-gt1 .
    - Turbo sound (which one to test?).
    - Ground scratching, try with Player clkdtm (any car with soft suspension).
    - Sand sound.
    - Barrier scratching sound.

Gamemodes:
----------

- check every gamemode, to accelerate it reduce the laps to run in the xml
  files.

- Check the result files (Correct location, intermediate results, XSLT).


Tracks:
-------

- Is every track selectable?

- Are any textures missing?

- Are holes in the track?


Cars:
-----



Robots:
-------

- check if robots crash when you restart the race within the time -2..0.

- each module must have run at least a few laps on every track with at least
  2 robots out of it if more than 1 is available, racing against some
  opponents. Good way to do it is a quickrace on every track.

- Robots which have some kind of experience saving: Check if saving works,
  check if loading works, and check as well what happens when no data files
  are present.
