PRODUCTION

Coupe 9,936

Convertible 18,630

TOTAL 28,566

 

Production hit an all time high in 1968, with 28,556 Corvettes sold. This was due to a totally new body design, which borrowed heavily from the Mako Shark show car. This basic body design would continue on until the 1982 model year. Although the body was new, the chassis, brakes and drivetrain were basically the same as the 1967 model. The new Corvette was seven inches longer, 1/2 inch lower and sat two inches lower than the 1967 Sting Ray it replaced. Interestingly, the Sting Ray designation was dropped.

Two body styles were once again available, a coupe and convertible. The coupe featured removable roof panels, known as T-Top and the rear window was also removable. Although the headlights were hidden in the body, unlike the 1963-67 versions which rotated to their on position, the 1968 Corvette's lights were of a pop-up design. Other notable changes were the elimination of the side vent windows and hidden windshield wipers.

Engine and transmission were basically carry-over from 1967, but with some differences. The most notable of these was the substitution of the superior Turbo Hydra-Matic three speed automatic transmission in place of the dated two-speed Powerglide automatic The Corvette was fitted with the TH400 version. A minor change occurred with both 300 and 350hp versions of the 327 c.i. V-8. as well as the L36 427 c.i. V-8. A Rochester Quadrajet four-barrel carburetor replaced the previous Holley four barrel.

427 c.i. V-8 production was as follows: L36 390hp-7,717, L68 400hp-1,932, L71 435hp-2,898, L88 430hp-80, L89 435hp-624. As before the 400hp and 435hp engines utilized a Holley three two-barrel carburetor setup.
