			 SUBARU 555 World Rally Car Version 6.1 (FINAL)

			Well it took me a while to fix the FINAL version , Rocket gave me a good tip on how to make the roof of the car
			not through-lookable anymore, so Thanx Rocket. Also Thomas Egelkraut was very helpful so Thanx 
			Thomas. SO I had to update the Car to version 6.1,  FINAL !!!! sorry !!

			What is NEW : 
			I fixed the roof, 	
			Added a REAL licence-plate on the back  ,
			Added a Subaru SUN Banner on the front Window ,
			Added the Names of the drivers on the side windows, 	
			Finetuned the AI (Artificial Intelligence) of the opponent car ,
			
			I like to thank all of my friends , who helped me out or gave me some good advice !		

			EVERYONE HAVE LOTS of FUN , this will be the FINAL release of the Subaru WRC 555.

			THANX Patrick

			Subaru 555 World Rally Car update 6.0  

			
			Hello Everone, 

			I did not keep my promise for the FINAL update at V 5.0 , but there are a lot of Graphical 
			improvements , I will start right here with the list :
			-Added an Interior, with sides, bottom ,and REAL Dashboard in the car, 2 seats, a Driver,
			a Co-Driver, both have a body , a helmet and a FACE, the helmets even have a transparant 
			vizer, so look very good through the vizer to see the faces !!! 2 seats , an inside mirror,
			and 2 Rolbars like in the real one !
			I added a NEW Sound , with the typical Rally Backshifting sound, everyone knows, when you decelerate
			it will bring some 'bangs' in the noise of the engine, like shifiting the Baby a gear back !
			Also Much improved AI , when you like to drive now against this car as an opponent, you really need 
			to work and drive like a real Pro , to keep him from finishing first !!!
			Well I guess this will do it and this will be the FINAL RElease of the Subaru Impreza 555 WRC.
			
			Special Thanx go to Addict for helping me out with the interior !!! THANX 

			HAVE LOTS OF FUN and drive like a PRO !!

			Version 5.0 update !	

			Well everybody , it was time to update the Subaru 555 WRC from it original model and textures
			to a NEW model and NEW textures, I will explain it now !!!
			This Subaru 555 WRC was made after a lot of requests for the car , and I made it in December 1998,
			as my first try-out for NFS3
			It worked rather well, but due to the limitations of the programs than , we did not knew 
			how to edit and model the car and textures quite well, so I moved the vertices a bit around 
			but not too much or else the textures were distorted, so I managed to remodel it and still keep 
			the textures in the right position !!!! But NOW ................,	
			As I saw a few (illegal) copies of my Subaru 555 SV and WRC on the net, I thought well maybe it is time,
			to once and for all , make the REAL Subaru 555 SV, with the real model en real textures on it.	
			And so I did ,I remodeled the car completely, added a REAL Airintake on the Hood , and managed 
			to get the textures NON-Mirrored on the car ! I also changed the loadscreen , and added the 
			Patwo Design production 1999 text, further more , I digitized a video shot of my own DASH , 	
			and managed to get it in to the PC, I haev been drawing a whole day , to remove the steering 
			wheel from the picture, and to put what was supposed to be behind the wheel in to the pic, well	
			after 2 days that was also done, and was the only thing to edit this readme.txt . 	
			I did change the performance a little , because it was pretty much a bit to fast for real life, 
			basically the TOP speed is lowered a bit , so it is now a little bit slower , but much more like it should be.
			And so it is a lot more fun to drive, because NOW it takes some skills to stay first !!!(not only speed).
			
			This will be (if there are no bugs found of course) the FINAL update and that will be it !!!
			Well I think I made a very good replica of the Subaru 555 WRC, and for a lot of people it is 
			as close as they will ever get to drive one ! For me also , because the WRC's are NOT available.
			So Everybody out there, HAVE LOTS OF FUN with the car and also everyone who helped me out,
			supported me , mailed me and all of that .......	
			
			THANX A LOT !!!!!!!
