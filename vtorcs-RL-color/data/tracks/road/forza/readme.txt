Forza is based on a SCGT track by William Butler and Sean Stafford.  It is not
meant to be an exact replica of the current Monza track; for instance, I've
not included the tight chicane that exists halfway down the main straight on
the real circuit.  I basically wanted to make a track that was very fast and
flowing.  The main straight is wider than the rest of the track, which I don't
think has been done in TORCS before.
