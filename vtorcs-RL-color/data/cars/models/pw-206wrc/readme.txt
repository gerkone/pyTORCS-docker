Description             : Peugeot 206 WRC Version 1.0

			Hi Everyone ,  
			
			Here it is , the 206 WRC , one of the most eagerly awaited WRC cars for NFS 3, it took 
			me a long time to get it ready , 2 reasons for that, first of all I did not have so much 
			time as before, my work is taking up loads of time, and secondly I have been building 2
			versions of the car , one for Need For Speed 4 and one for Midtown Madness. Well It is 
			now to ready to Rock and Roll, it has some great features, well most of you know them 
			already from the WRCars before, but here they are: Driver and Co-Driver , the codriver is 
			holding a Real Map of the road, Peugeot 206 DASH, the REAL WRC Spoiler with 3rd brake light.
			and rollbars, inside mirror, antenna's that BEND also when you crash and many more, 
			exhaust pipe, lowered model, with REAL modeled front grill. And for the very first time I 
			was able to ADD some WIPERS, well they are on the windows of course, but... crash the car
			hard into another car or wall and the window will splatter and the wipers will bend forward, 
			just like in real life...!!! One great feature I did not implement before, also the car 
			has a FULL NONMIRRORED texture, so I was able to make the 2 lions of the Peugeot Logo of the
			car over the FULL BODY , this was One of the worst things to do , as it took me a awfull lot
			time to make sure the TEXTURES were aligned over ALL the 5 sides of the CAR BODY ... but as I 
			to make the cars perfect and better than before... I managed to get it done... 
			Of course the NFS 3 Hot Pursuit Version has NO damage and less light dummies in the car, 
			but the rest is the same , and it looks just like the NFS 4 cars....
			
			So Finally you are able to drive this MASTER PIECE of the Peugeot 206 WRC , and I love it a
			lot , great drivability and LOTS of fun to drive ...
