Description             : Toyota Corolla WRC

			Version 6.1 FINAL !!!

			Well again a FINAL version but this one is really final ,it is mainly the SAME of the NFS 4
			version , the drivers and more stuff are added. The Driver and the Co-Driver are added , the 
			Co-Driver is holding the MAP of the road they need to navigate, I added an antenna (3D model ) 
			also the Exhaustpipe is 3D modeled and added, the rolbars and mirror inside is also in the car.
			There is a 3rd brake light on the back of the car , but due to limitations of NFS 3 I can not
			make it like JUST a 3rd brake light so it is not working. Also the animations of the drivers as 
			is the damage of the NFS 4 cars is removed.			
			I tuned the perfromance a little bit also , finetuning so to say . 
			I hope you really like the NEW model of the Toyota Corolla WRC , and Drive Like a Pro , 
			If you Can Handle it !!!.

			Version 6.0 (FINAL) (6.0 is because all of the FINAL cars are in the 6.x version )

			 
			Well it took me a while to fix the FINAL version , Rocket gave me a good tip on how to make the roof of the car
			not through-lookable anymore, so Thanx Rocket. Also Thomas Egelkraut was very helpful so Thanx 
			Thomas. 

			What is NEW : 
			there are a lot of Graphical Improvements , I will start right here with the list :
			-Added an Interior,with dash in the car , and with sides, bottom ,and NEWLY DESIGNED (by Patwo Design ) Dashboard in the car, 
			2 seats, a Driver, a Co-Driver, both have a body , a helmet and a FACE, the helmets even have a transparant 
			visor, so look very good through the visor to see the faces !!! 2 seats , an inside mirror,
			and 1 Rolbars like in the real one !
			I added a NEW Sound , with the typical Rally Backshifting sound, everyone knows, when you decelerate
			it will bring some 'bangs' in the noise of the engine, like shifiting the Baby a gear back !
			
			Also Much improved AI , when you like to drive now against this car as an opponent, you really need 
			to work and drive like a real Pro , to keep him from finishing first !!!
						
			I fixed the roof, 	
			
			Added a REAL licence-plate on the back  ,
			Added a Corolla SUN Banner on the front Window ,
			and the Drivers names are on the side windows !
			
						
			I like to thank all of my friends , who helped me out or gave me some good advice !		

			EVERYONE HAVE LOTS of FUN , this will be the FINAL release of the Toyota Corolla WRC
			THANX Patrick 	
			
			Patwo Design 1999.





			 Version 1.0	
			
			Finally , here it is in the version 1.0 , 
			The tricky part of the car was the modeling, and in the same time, wrecking the mapping 
			on the car. So it was kind of difficult to get the mapping all the way right. But in the 
			end it worked out pretty well after some practise !
			The big problem was how to build the car00.tga file in a way , that the mirroring on the 
			Car would dissapear. 
			Well my first attempts weretoo much effort, especially with the small triangles where you
			could not see what I was doing. So I decided to start as usual again , with the mirroring
			effects, and solve it on the way to the end ! I must say it is pretty good !, not every 
			part of the car can be mirrored back to the right spot, but some of them can ! So the
			result is a car with not very visible mirroring !
				
			I made the car a very good competitor for the other World Rally Cars,  as for every Rally 
			car they handle like a dream, due to the 4 wheel drive, the car is very stable at high 
			speeds and can take corners like you wouldn't believe it , the acceleration is everything
			on a rally car, so it flies like Hell ! Flying low over the tracks this car loves every
			track especailly with nice corners and a little bit off-road !
			Well the Toyota Corolla was awaited for a long time, loads of people were asking for it ,
			so finally here it is , it drives like heaven so give it a try , against the other WRC's.

			Take Care, Patrick
