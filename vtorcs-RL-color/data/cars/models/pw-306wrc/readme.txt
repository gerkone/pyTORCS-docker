Description             : Peugeot 306 Maxi WRC

			Version 6.1 (FINAL) (UPDATED as the NFS 4 HS Cars ) 
 			
			Peugeot 306 MAXI WRC Version 6.1

			Hi Everyone ,  
			


			Well it is ready, the  NFS 3 car from the model for the NFS4 game . I tried to make it even 
			better than the OLDER NFS 3 version so I remodeled the car once more and removed the interior .
			It was really time to make them also available for NFS4 and so I did ...I took the OLD 
			model and Added the driver the interior and all the NFS4 cars have...brakes , dashes, seats, 
			and more...., I added  the Driver ...  .
			What I also did was add a 3D Exhaustpipe for the beautiful sound the engines produces ,
			and an 3D modeled Antenna to communicate to the crew along the track if necessary.
			The Driver is assisted by a CO-driver 
			who is actually READING the MAP he is holding in his hand !  ( look closely )  I also added the 
			3rd Brake light on the spoiler ..., but as in nfs 3 it is NOT working due to lack of a Seperate
			brakelight , not in combination with the taillights...sorry ...
			
			It took  me quite a while as I needed to redesign the CAR00.tga file and the NEW model parts 
			needed to be converted in and the OLD drivers and Interior was to be removed ...and replaced by the
			new moving ones..., also the DASH in the car is the same as in the INSIDE view , Well and of
			course it took me some time to get the antenna and Exhaustpipe

			Version 6.0
			 
			Well it took me a while to fix the FINAL version , Rocket gave me a good tip on how to make the roof of the car
			not through-lookable anymore, so Thanx Rocket. Also Thomas Egelkraut was very helpful so Thanx 
			Thomas. 

			What is NEW : 
			there are a lot of Graphical Improvements , I will start right here with the list :
			-Added an Interior, with sides, bottom ,and NEWLY DESIGNED (by Patwo Design ) Dashboard in the car, 
			2 seats, a Driver, a Co-Driver, both have a body , a helmet and a FACE, the helmets even have a transparant 
			visor, so look very good through the visor to see the faces !!! 2 seats , an inside mirror,
			and 1 Rolbars like in the real one !
			I added a NEW Sound , with the typical Rally Backshifting sound, everyone knows, when you decelerate
			it will bring some 'bangs' in the noise of the engine, like shifiting the Baby a gear back !
			
			Also Much improved AI , when you like to drive now against this car as an opponent, you really need 
			to work and drive like a real Pro , to keep him from finishing first !!!
						
			I fixed the roof, 	
			
			Added a REAL licence-plate on the back  ,
			Added a Peugeot SUN Banner on the front Window ,
			
						
			I like to thank all of my friends , who helped me out or gave me some good advice !		

			EVERYONE HAVE LOTS of FUN , this will be the FINAL release of the Peugeot 306 Maxi WRC
			THANX Patrick

			 Version 1.0	
			
			Finally , here it is in the version 1.0 , 
			The tricky part of the car was the modeling, and in the same time, wrecking the mapping 
			on the car. So it was kind of difficult to get the mapping all the way right. But in the 
			end it worked out pretty well after some practise !
			The big problem was how to build the car00.tga file in a way , that the mirroring on the 
			Car would dissapear. 
			Well my first attempts weretoo much effort, especially with the small triangles where you
			could not see what I was doing. So I decided to start as usual again , with the mirroring
			effects, and solve it on the way to the end ! I must say it is pretty good !, not every 
			part of the car can be mirrored back to the right spot, but some of them can ! So the
			result is a car with not very visible mirroring !
				
			I made the car a very good competitor for the other World Rally Cars, not as quick as the 
			Subaru WRC or the Mitsubishi WRC, but they are a different group , so don't worry , as for
			every Rally car they handle like a dream, due to the 4 wheel drive, the car is very stable
			at high speeds and can take corners like you wouldn't believe it , the acceleration is every
			thing on a rally car, so it flies like Hell ! Flying low over the tracks this car loves every
			track especailly with nice corners and a little bit off-road !
			Everybody have FUN with it , it is not a American or Japanese car but the French guys know 
			how to make a beauty of a car , that drives like a beast !
			
			Take Care, Patrick 
			
                     		

Installation		:First of all make a new directory in your carmodel 
			directory and name it 306W. That's all dudes....
			Unzip the file and copy the car.viv file and  everything else
			to the ...\gamedata\carmodel\306W  directory.
			Copy the file 29_00.qfs to the NFS3\Fedata\Art\Slides. directory.

			I have noticed , that if you have the Rosco Cop Car of Xtonyx installed, you get a duplicate car
			error, , so you have to	delete the Rosco Cop Car, if you want to drive the Peugeot 306 , or use the serial num. wizard to give
			the Rosco Cop Car a diffferent number .
