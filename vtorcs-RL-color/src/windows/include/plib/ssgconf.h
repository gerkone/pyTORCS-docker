/* The following defines give you the ability to remove code from the
 * library that you will not be using.  I wish I could figure out how to
 * automate this, but I can't do that without making it seriously hard
 * on the users.  So if you are not using an ability, change the #define
 * to and #undef, and that part of the library will not be compiled.  If
 * your linker can't find a function, you may want to make sure the
 * ability is defined here.
