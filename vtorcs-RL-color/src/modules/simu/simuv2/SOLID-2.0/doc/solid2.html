<H2><A NAME="SEC2" HREF="solid2_toc.html#TOC2">Preamble</A></H2>

<P>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

</P>
<P>
  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
your libraries, too.

</P>
<P>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

</P>
<P>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.

</P>
<P>
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

</P>
<P>
  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

</P>
<P>
  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
the original authors' reputations.

</P>
<P>
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
free use or not licensed at all.

</P>
<P>
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This
license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary
one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
the same as in the ordinary license.

</P>
<P>
  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in
a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
treats it as such.

</P>
<P>
  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.

</P>
<P>
  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to
permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve
this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this
will lead to faster development of free libraries.

</P>
<P>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
works together with the library.

</P>
<P>
  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
General Public License rather than by this special one.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="solid2_toc.html#TOC3">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</A></H2>


<OL>
<LI>

This License Agreement applies to any software library which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is
addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.
  
<LI>

You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

<LI>

You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:


<OL>
<LI>

The modified work must itself be a software library.

<LI>

You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

<LI>

You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

<LI>

If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
in the event an application does not supply such function or
table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
its purpose remains meaningful.

(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
application-supplied function or table used by this function must
be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
root function must still compute square roots.)
</OL>

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

<LI>

You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

<LI>

You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

<LI>

A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

<LI>

As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:


<OL>
<LI>

Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
to use the modified definitions.)

<LI>

Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
least three years, to give the same user the materials
specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
than the cost of performing this distribution.

<LI>

If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
specified materials from the same place.

<LI>

Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
</OL>

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

<LI>

You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:


<OL>
<LI>

Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
Sections above.

<LI>

Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
</OL>

<LI>

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

<LI>

You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

<LI>

Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

<LI>

If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

<LI>

If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

<LI>

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

<LI>

If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.



<P><STRONG>NO WARRANTY</STRONG></P>

<LI>

BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE

LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

<LI>

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

<P>
  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest

everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

</P>
<P>
  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the

<H1><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="solid2_toc.html#TOC5">Introduction</A></H1>

<P>
SOLID is a library for collision detection of three-dimensional objects undergoing rigid motion and deformation.
SOLID is designed to be used in interactive 3D graphics applications, and is especially suited for collision detection
of objects and worlds described in VRML.  Some of its features are: 

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Object shapes are represented by primitive shapes (box, cone, cylinder,
sphere), and complexes of polytopes (line segments, convex polygons,
convex polyhedra). A single shape can be used to instantiate multiple
objects. 

<LI>

Motion is specified by translations, rotations, and nonuniform scalings
of the local  coordinate system of each moving object. These changes can
be given absolute or relative to the previous frame. The local
coordinate system can also be set according to an array of sixteen
floats or doubles representing a 4x4 column-major matrix of an affine
transformation, as used in OpenGL. 

<LI>

Deformations of complex shapes can be specified using client-defined
vertex arrays. 

<LI>

Collision response is defined by the client by means of call-back
functions. Response may be defined per object pair, for all pairs
containing a specific object, and as default for all pairs of objects.  

<LI>

Response call-backs can use collision data describing the configuration
of a pair of colliding objects. As collision data can be used: a point common
to both objects, or the closest point pair of the objects from
the previous frame. The latter response type can be used for
approximating the collision plane in physics-based simulations.

<LI>

Frame coherence is exploited by maintaining a set of pairs of proximate
objects (incremental sweep and prune of axis-aligned bounding boxes),
and caching separating axes for these pairs.  This feature is optional
and may be turned on/off at any time during a simulation.  
</UL>

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="solid2_toc.html#TOC6">Installing SOLID</A></H1>



<H2><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="solid2_toc.html#TOC7">Requirements</A></H2>

<P>
The library is written in standard C++ and relies heavily on the
STL. Currently, it compiles under GNU g++ version 2.8.1 and up. 
The library has a standard C API and can be linked to both C and C++
applications. In order to link it to C applications you need the
libstdc++ library. 

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC8" HREF="solid2_toc.html#TOC8">Installation</A></H2>

<P>
In case you have a recent GNU developers environment installed, simply
typing <SAMP>`make'</SAMP> in the root of the distribution directory will build the
library, a sample client and documentation.

</P>
<P>
If you want to use another compiler, you should make the necessary changes
to the <TT>`Make-config'</TT> file in the root directory. See the comments
in this file for details.

</P>
<P>
The auxiliary C++ classes in <SAMP>`include/3D'</SAMP> for performing affine
transformation in 3D have all their code inlined, so you do not need to
link a library in order to use them. 

</P>


<H1><A NAME="SEC9" HREF="solid2_toc.html#TOC9">Trouble in Installation</A></H1>

<P>
Q: My compiler cannot figure out the templates used in the SOLID
source! What's the matter?

</P>
<P>
A: Your compiler does not comply with the ISO standard for C++. Install
the GNU g++ compiler version 2.8.1 or higher for your platform.  

</P>


<H1><A NAME="SEC10" HREF="solid2_toc.html#TOC10">The SOLID API</A></H1>



<H2><A NAME="SEC11" HREF="solid2_toc.html#TOC11">Building Shapes</A></H2>

<P>
The commands for creating and destroying shapes are 

<PRE>
DtShapeRef dtBox(DtScalar x, DtScalar y, DtScalar z);
DtShapeRef dtCone(DtScalar radius, DtScalar height);
DtShapeRef dtCylinder(DtScalar radius, DtScalar height);
DtShapeRef dtSphere(DtScalar radius);
DtShapeRef dtNewComplexShape();

void dtDeleteShape(DtShapeRef shape);
</PRE>

<P>
Shapes are referred to by values of <CODE>DtShapeRef</CODE>. 
Currently, the type <CODE>DtScalar</CODE> is defined as <CODE>double</CODE>.
The command <CODE>dtBox</CODE> creates a rectangular parallelepiped centered
at the origin and aligned with the axes of the shape's local coordinate system.
The parameters specify its extent along the respective coordinate axes.
The commands <CODE>dtCone</CODE> and <CODE>dtCylinder</CODE> create respectively a
cone and a cylinder centered
at the origin and whose central axis is aligned with the Y-axis of the
local coordinate system.
The cone's apex is at y = height / 2. 
The command <CODE>dtSphere</CODE> creates a sphere centered at the origin of
the local coordinate system.

</P>
<P>
Other shape types based on point data, such as polygon soups, simplicial
complexes, (compositions of) convex polyhedra, are created by the 
<CODE>dtNewComplexShape</CODE> command.
For constructing complex shapes the following commands are used: 

<PRE>
DtShapeRef dtNewComplexShape();
void dtEndComplexShape();

void dtBegin(DtPolyType type);
void dtEnd();
void dtVertex(DtScalar x, DtScalar y, DtScalar z);

void dtVertexBase(const void *base);
void dtVertexIndex(DtIndex index);
void dtVertexIndices(DtPolyType type, DtCount count, const DtIndex *indices);
void dtVertexRange(DtPolyType type, DtIndex first, DtCount count); 
</PRE>

<P>
A complex shape is composed of d-dimensional polytopes, where
d is at most 3. 
A d-polytope can be a simplex (point, line segment, triangle,
tetrahedron), a convex polygon, or a convex polyhedron.
The type of d-polytope is specified by a value of
<CODE>DtPolyType</CODE>, defined as 

<PRE>
typedef enum DtPolyType {
  DT_SIMPLEX,
  DT_POLYGON,
  DT_POLYHEDRON
} DtPolyType;
</PRE>

<P>
A d-polytope is specified by enumerating its vertices. This can be done
in two ways. In the first way, the vertices are specified by value,
using the <CODE>dtVertex</CODE> command. The following example shows how the
faces of a pyramid are specified.   

<PRE>
DtShapeRef pyramid = dtNewComplexShape();

dtBegin(DT_SIMPLEX);
dtVertex(1.0, 0.0, 1.0); 
dtVertex(1.0, 0.0, -1.0); 
dtVertex(-1.0, 0.0, -1.0); 
dtVertex(-1.0, 0.0, 1.0);
dtEnd();

dtBegin(DT_SIMPLEX);
dtVertex(1.0, 0.0, 1.0); 
dtVertex(1.0, 0.0, -1.0); 
dtVertex(0.0, 1.27, 0.0); 
dtEnd();

...

dtEndComplexShape();
</PRE>

<P>
In the second method, the vertices are stored in an array, and are
referred to by indices. 
For each complex shape, we can specify a single array.
A vertex array is specified by  the command <CODE>dtVertexBase</CODE>, which
takes the address of the first element in the array, referred to as the base of
the array, as argument. 
The command <CODE>dtVertexIndex</CODE> is used for
specifying vertices. See the following example:

<PRE>
DtScalar vertices[5 * 3] = { 
  1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 
  1.0, 0.0, -1.0, 
  -1.0, 0.0, -1.0, 
  -1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 
  0.0, 1.27, 0.0 
};

DtShapeRef pyramid = dtNewComplexShape();
dtVertexBase(vertices);

dtBegin(DT_SIMPLEX);
dtVertexIndex(0); 
dtVertexIndex(1); 
dtVertexIndex(2); 
dtVertexIndex(3); 
dtEnd();

dtBegin(DT_SIMPLEX);
dtVertexIndex(0); 
dtVertexIndex(1); 
dtVertexIndex(4); 
dtEnd();

...

dtEndComplexShape();
</PRE>

<P>
Alternatively, the indices can be placed into an array and specified
using the command <CODE>dtVertexIndices</CODE>, as in the following example:

<PRE>
DtScalar vertices[5 * 3] = { 
  1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 
  1.0, 0.0, -1.0, 
  -1.0, 0.0, -1.0, 
  -1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 
  0.0, 1.27, 0.0 
};

DtIndex face0[4] = { 0, 1, 2, 3 };
DtIndex face1[3] = { 0, 1, 4 };

...

DtShapeRef pyramid = dtNewComplexShape();
dtVertexBase(vertices);

dtVertexIndices(DT_SIMPLEX, 4, face0);
dtVertexIndices(DT_SIMPLEX, 3, face1);

...

dtEndComplexShape();
</PRE>

<P>
Finally, a polytope can be specified from a range of vertices using the
command <CODE>dtVertexRange</CODE>.
The range is specified by the first index and the number of vertices.
In the following example a pyramid is constructed as a convex polyhedron,
which is the convex hull of the vertices in the array.

<PRE>
DtScalar vertices[5 * 3] = { 
  1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 
  1.0, 0.0, -1.0, 
  -1.0, 0.0, -1.0, 
  -1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 
  0.0, 1.27, 0.0 
};

DtShapeRef pyramid = dtNewComplexShape();
dtVertexBase(vertices);
dtVertexRange(DT_POLYHEDRON, 0, 5);
dtEndComplexShape();
</PRE>

<P>
Note that the vertices of a simplex need not be affinely independent,
and the vertices specifying a convex polyhedron need not be extreme
vertices of the convex hull.
However, in order to construct a proper convex polygon, the vertices
should be approximately coplanar and specified in the order as they
appear on the boundary.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC12" HREF="solid2_toc.html#TOC12">Creating and Moving Objects</A></H2>

<P>
An object is an instance of a shape.
The commands for creating, moving and deleting objects are 

<PRE>
void dtCreateObject(DtObjectRef object, DtShapeRef shape); 
void dtDeleteObject(DtObjectRef object);
void dtSelectObject(DtObjectRef object);

void dtLoadIdentity();

void dtLoadMatrixf(const float *m);
void dtLoadMatrixd(const double *m);

void dtMultMatrixf(const float *m);
void dtMultMatrixd(const double *m);

void dtTranslate(DtScalar x, DtScalar y, DtScalar z);
void dtRotate(DtScalar x, DtScalar y, DtScalar z, DtScalar w);
void dtScale(DtScalar x, DtScalar y, DtScalar z);

</PRE>

<P>
An object is referred to by a <CODE>DtObjectRef</CODE>, which is defined
as <CODE>void *</CODE>. 
Any pointer type may be used to refer to an object. In general,
a pointer to a structure in the client application associated with the
collision object should be used.

</P>
<P>
An object's motion is specified by changing the placement of the local
coordinate system of the shape.  
Initially, the local coordinate system of an object
coincides with the world coordinate system. 

</P>
<P>
The <STRONG>current object</STRONG> is the last created or selected object.
The placement of the current object is changed, either by translations,
rotations and nonuniform scalings, or by using an OpenGL 4x4
column-major matrix representing an affine transformation. 
Placements are specified absolute or relative to the previous placement.
Rotations are specified using quaternions. 
Following example shows how a pair
of objects are given absolute placements.  

<PRE>
dtCreateObject(&#38;object1, hammer);
dtCreateObject(&#38;object2, nail);

dtSelectObject(&#38;object1);
dtLoadIdentity();
dtTranslate(0, 1, 1);
dtRotate(0, 0, 1, 0);

dtSelectObject(&#38;object2);
dtLoadIdentity();
dtTranslate(0, 1, 0);
dtRotate(0, 0, 0, 1);
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="SEC13" HREF="solid2_toc.html#TOC13">Who's Afraid of Quaternions?</A></H3>

<P>
A quaternion is a four-dimensional vector. The set of quaternions of
length one (points on a four-dimensional sphere) map to the set of
orientations in three-dimensional space. Since in many applications an
orientation defined by either a rotation axis and angle or by a
triple of Euler angles is more convenient, the package includes code for
quaternion operations. The code is found in a library of C++ classes for
3D affine transformations. The classes are found in the 
<TT>`include/3D'</TT> directory. All the code is inlined so you do not need
to link a library in order to use the classes.

</P>
<P>
The quaternion class is found in the file <TT>`Quaternion.h'</TT>. The class
has constructors and methods for setting a quaternion. For example

<PRE>
Quaternion q1(axis, angle);
Quaternion q2(yaw, pitch, roll);

...

q1.setRotation(axis, angle);
q2.setEuler(yaw, pitch, roll);

...

dtRotate(q1[X], q1[Y], q1[Z], q1[W]);
</PRE>

<P>
Also included is a static method <CODE>Quaternion::random()</CODE>, which
returns a random orientation.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC14" HREF="solid2_toc.html#TOC14">Response Handling</A></H2>

<P>
Collision response in SOLID is handled by means of callback functions.
The callback functions have the type <CODE>DtResponse</CODE> defined by

<PRE>
 typedef void (*DtResponse)(
   void *client_data, 
   DtObjectRef object1, 
   DtObjectRef object2,
   const DtCollData *coll_data)
</PRE>

<P>
Here, <CODE>client_data</CODE> is a pointer to an arbitrary structure in the
client application, <CODE>object1</CODE> and <CODE>object2</CODE> are colliding
objects, and <CODE>coll_data</CODE> is the response data computed by SOLID.

</P>
<P>
Currently, there are three types of response: <STRONG>simple</STRONG>,
<STRONG>smart</STRONG> and <STRONG>witnessed</STRONG> response. For simple response the value
of <CODE>coll_data</CODE> is <CODE>NULL</CODE>. 
For smart and witnessed response <CODE>coll_data</CODE> points to the
following structure 

<PRE>
typedef struct DtCollData {
  DtVector point1;
  DtVector point2;
  DtVector normal;
} DtCollData;
</PRE>

<P>
An object of this type represents a pair of points of the respective
objects. The points  <CODE>point1</CODE> and <CODE>point2</CODE> are given relative
to the local coordinate system of their respective objects
<CODE>object1</CODE> and <CODE>object2</CODE>. The <CODE>normal</CODE> field is used for smart
response only. 

</P>
<P>
For witnessed response, the points represent a witness of the collision.
As a result of this the global coordinates of the witness points are
equal.
For smart response, the points represent the closest point pair of the
objects at placements from the previous time frame. The
<CODE>normal</CODE> field contains the difference of the global
coordinates of the closest point pair, i.e., <CODE>normal = Global(point1) - Global(point2)</CODE>.
We will discuss this type of response more thoroughly further on.

</P>
<P>
Response is defined as <STRONG>default response</STRONG> for all pairs of objects, as
<STRONG>object response</STRONG> for all pairs containing a given object, or as
<STRONG>pair response</STRONG> for a particular pair of objects. The commands for
defining and undefining response are  

<PRE>
void dtSetDefaultResponse(DtResponse response, DtResponseType type, 
			  void *client_data)  
void dtClearDefaultResponse()

void dtSetObjectResponse(DtObjectRef obj, DtResponse response, 
			 DtResponseType type, void *client_data)
void dtClearObjectResponse(DtObjectRef obj)
void dtResetObjectResponse(DtObjectRef obj)

void dtSetPairResponse(DtObjectRef obj1, DtObjectRef obj2, 
		       DtResponse response, DtResponseType type, 
		       void *client_data)
void dtClearPairResponse(DtObjectRef obj1, DtObjectRef obj2)
void dtResetPairResponse(DtObjectRef obj1, DtObjectRef obj2)
</PRE>

<P>
A response is defined by either a <CODE>Set</CODE> or a
<CODE>Clear</CODE> command.
The <CODE>Clear</CODE> command defines the response to be nil (no response). 

</P>
<P>
Initially, the default response is nil and all pairs of objects have a
default response. 
If for an object pair, one of the objects has an object response defined,
then this response overrules the default response. A pair response
overrules any object or default response. 
If for both objects there is an object response defined, then one of the
responses is chosen. In this case, one of the responses may be forced to
be chosen by defining it as a pair response.

</P>
<P>
A response is undefined, i.e., reset to a more general setting, by the
<CODE>Reset</CODE> commands. 
The command <CODE>dtResetPairResponse</CODE> resets the response of a pair of
objects to an object response, if one is defined for an object in the pair,
or otherwise to the default response.
The command <CODE>dtResetObjectResponse</CODE> resets the responses of the object
pairs, for which no other object response or a pair response is defined, to 
the default response.
Note that whenever an object is deleted, the object response and
all pair responses that are set for this object are reset automatically.     

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>DtResponseType</CODE> is defined by

<PRE>
  typedef enum DtResponseType { 
    DT_NO_RESPONSE,
    DT_SIMPLE_RESPONSE, 
    DT_SMART_RESPONSE,
    DT_WITNESSED_RESPONSE   
  } DtResponseType
</PRE>

<P>
Setting the response type to <CODE>DT_NO_RESPONSE</CODE> is equivalent to 
clearing the response.

</P>
<P>
The response callback functions are executed for each colliding pair of
objects by calling

<PRE>
int dtTest()
</PRE>

<P>
This function returns the number of callback functions that are executed.
  


<H3><A NAME="SEC15" HREF="solid2_toc.html#TOC15">Smart Response</A></H3>

<P>
For physics-based simulations it is often necessary to have a
representation of the collision plane of a pair of colliding objects in
order to compute the reaction forces. 
From a single configuration of two colliding objects it is hard to compute a
collision plane, since there is no knowledge of how this configuration
came about. 
Therefore, SOLID uses the configuration of the objects from the
previous time frame for approximating the collision plane.
If the objects were disjoint in the previous time frame, then the
vector defined by the difference of the closest point pair of the objects is
a good approximation of the collision plane's normal. 

</P>
<P>
By selecting smart response for a pair of objects, the closest point
pair and the normal from the previous time frame are
computed. 
The points <CODE>point1</CODE> and <CODE>point2</CODE> are given in local
coordinates and the <CODE>normal</CODE> relative to the 
global basis and pointing away from <CODE>object2</CODE>. 
In order to compute these values, the configuration of
objects must be stored in each time frame. This is done by calling 

<PRE>
void dtProceed();
</PRE>

<P>
Note that in order to guarantee that a non-zero normal can be found,
the <CODE>dtProceed</CODE> command may only be called if all object pairs for
which a smart response is defined, are disjoint!
The common way of guarding this is by iteratively doing collision tests
and changing the placements until the objects are disjoint.
Note that it is possible and often necessary to call <CODE>dtTest</CODE>
multiple times before calling <CODE>dtProceed</CODE>.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC16" HREF="solid2_toc.html#TOC16">Deformable Models</A></H2>

<P>
SOLID handles deformations of complex shapes.  In this context
deformations are specified by changes of vertex positions. 
Complex shapes that are defined using a vertex array in the client
application may be deformed by changing the array elements, or
specifying a new array. 
SOLID is notified of a change of vertices by the command 

<PRE>
void dtChangeVertexBase(DtShapeRef shape, const void *base);
</PRE>

<P>
When using convex polygons or convex polyhedra as shape components, the
client should warrant that the vertex changes do not violate the
convexity and topology (planar graph embedding) of a component!  

</P>
<P>
Note that in order to use smart response for deformable shapes, the
change of vertices should be done by specifying a new array.
The vertex array of the previous time frame should be kept intact,
otherwise SOLID can not determine the configuration of objects of the
previous time frame.
This is best handled by applying a `double buffering' technique.
After a call to <CODE>dtProceed</CODE>, the new vertex positions are placed in the
free buffer of a pair of vertex buffers, and <CODE>dtChangeVertexBase</CODE>
is called using this buffer, after which the other buffer becomes the
free buffer.     

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC17" HREF="solid2_toc.html#TOC17">Caching</A></H2>

<P>
In computer animations there is usually a lot of frame coherence
(objects move smoothly).
In these cases, caching and reusing earlier computations will yield a
considerable performance improvement.  
The <STRONG>caching</STRONG> option of SOLID enables an incremental sort on the set
of objects, in order to reduce the number of pairwise intersection
tests. 
Moreover, when the cashing option is on, data from earlier intersection
tests is stored and used for faster determination of the intersection
status of a pair of objects.  
Caching is enabled and disabled by 

<PRE>
void dtEnableCaching()
void dtDisableCaching()
</PRE>

<P>
Caching may be enabled or disabled at any time during a
simulation. This option is enabled by default.
