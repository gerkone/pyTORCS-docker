	Fixed the setRotation method and <<-operator in Matrix.h. These
	were still for column-major matrices, however in SOLID 2.0 matrices
	are supposed to be row-major. Also, I modified the setEuler method
	in Quaternion.h. `Yaw' now corresponds with rotation around the
	Y-axis, `pitch' with the X-axis, and `roll' with the Z-axis.

January 24, 1999
	Added a safety margin to the extents of the bounding boxes for
	primitives in correspondence with the absolute error tolerance of
        the GJK intersection test, in order to avoid problems where objects
	are found intersecting whereas their bounding boxes are
	disjoint. Problem spotted by Arthur Johnson Jr.

January 8, 1999
	Renamed some variables and function names. Visual C++ 6.0 is
	troubled by too much variables or functions having the same name.
	Also, dtDeleteObject now removes the responses defined for the
	deleted object. Problems spotted, and fixes suggested by 
	Arthur Johnson Jr. 

December 21, 1998
	Streamlined bounding box computation routines.

December 11, 1998
	Bug fixed in `Basic.h'. Under Linux Redhat 5.2, `RAND_MAX + 1' used
	in the function `rnd()' is a negative number. Bug spotted and
	solved by Jason Surratt. 

September 23, 1998
	Bug fixed in `C-api.cpp' in the computation of the normal in smart
	response, spotted and fix suggested by Arthur Johnson Jr.  

September 14, 1998
	Bug fixed in `C-api.cpp' which prevented the use of multiple
	complex shapes, spotted and solved by Adam Machnik.
 
August 28, 1998 
	Public release of SOLID version 2.0
