        <h1>8.5 Pit Strategy Functions</h1>

		<h3>Introduction</h3>

		<p>
		  In this section we will finish the pit class. What is still missing is the
		  strategy functionality. I will show you a very simple implementation, which will
		  work quite well for endurance races, but not for short ones. It works exactly the
		  same way like in the berniw robot.
		</p>

		<h3>The update Method</h3>

		<p>
		  The update method is responsible for the housekeeping of some variables
		  and to decide if we need a pit stop.
		</p>

<p><pre class="lcolor">/* update pit data and strategy */
void Pit::update()
{
    if (mypit != NULL) {
        if (isBetween(car-&gt;_distFromStartLine)) {
            if (getPitstop()) {
                setInPit(true);
            }
        } else {
            setInPit(false);
        }</pre></p>

		<p>
		  If we are between pitentry and pitexit and pitstop is set, set inpit to true.
		  We need that to remember after the pit stop that we have to follow the pit
		  path to leave the pit lane. That is necessary because the pitstop variable is
		  set to false immediately after the pit stop, when we still need to drive out of
		  the pit lane and back to the track. If we are not between pitentry and pitexit
		  we set inpit to false.
		</p>

<p><pre class="lcolor">        /* check for damage */
        if (car-&gt;_dammage &gt; PIT_DAMMAGE) {
            setPitstop(true);
        }</pre></p>

		<p>
		  The first very simple strategy rule. If the damage of the car is greater than
		  PIT_DAMMAGE, we set pitstop to true. Here is very much room for improvement,
		  you could make that dependent on the remaining laps and the situation in the race.
		</p>

<p><pre class="lcolor">        /* fuel update */
        int id = car-&gt;_trkPos.seg->id;
        if (id &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; id &lt; 5 &amp;&amp; !fuelchecked) {</pre></p>

		<p>
		  We update the fuel values once per lap when we cross the track segment zero. We
		  check the range of 5 segments that we catch it for sure.
		</p>
<p><pre class="lcolor">            if (car-&gt;race.laps &gt; 0) {
                fuelperlap = MAX(fuelperlap, (lastfuel+lastpitfuel-car-&gt;priv.fuel));
            }
            lastfuel = car-&gt;priv.fuel;
            lastpitfuel = 0.0;
            fuelchecked = true;
        } else if (id &gt; 5) {
            fuelchecked = false;
        }</pre></p>

		<p>
		  We compute the amount of fuel which the car has consumed till the check
		  one lap before.
		  The amount of the consumed fuel on the last lap is usually the difference
		  between the available amount of fuel one lap ago (lastfuel) and the current
		  amount of fuel available
		  (car-&gt;priv.fuel). If we have performed a pit stop, this is not true. To make
		  the computation work we have to add to the lastfuel value the amount of new fuel
		  (lastpitfuel).
		</p>
		<p>
		  We take the maximum because if we get some damage or have to brake and accelarate
		  more than usual the car consumes more fuel. If you take the average you may
		  run out of fuel.
		</p>

<p><pre class="lcolor">        int laps = car-&gt;_remainingLaps-car-&gt;_lapsBehindLeader;
        if (!getPitstop() && laps &gt; 0) {
            if (car-&gt;_fuel &lt; 1.5*fuelperlap &amp;&amp;
                car-&gt;_fuel &lt; laps*fuelperlap) {
                setPitstop(true);
            }
        }</pre></p>

		<p>
		  Here comes the second strategy rule, feel also free to improve that. If there
		  are some laps remaining for our robot check if we have fuel for the
		  next one and a half laps and if we need to refuel at all. If that is the case
		  set pitstop to true.
		</p>

<p><pre class="lcolor">        if (getPitstop()) car-&gt;_raceCmd = RM_CMD_PIT_ASKED;
    }
}</pre></p>

		<p>
		  If pitstop is true set the race command accordingly (here we let TORCS know that
		  we want to pit). Our car is captured by the pit if the car is slow enough, near
		  enough to the center of our pit and if the race command is set to RM_CMD_PIT_ASKED.
		</p>

		<h3>The getFuel Method</h3>

		<p>
		  This method computes the amount of fuel we request on the pit stop. It is called
		  from the drivers Driver::pitCommand callback function (I will show you that soon).
		  It is also part of the strategy.
		</p>


<p><pre class="lcolor">/* Computes the amount of fuel */
float Pit::getFuel()
{
    float fuel;
    fuel = MAX(MIN((car-&gt;_remainingLaps+1.0)*fuelperlap - car-&gt;_fuel,
                    car-&gt;_tank - car-&gt;_fuel),
               0.0);
    lastpitfuel = fuel;
    return fuel;
}</pre></p>

		<p>
		  The fuel we need to finish the race is the difference between the remaining
		  laps
		  times the fuel we need per lap and the fuel in the tank. To play safe we
		  request fuel for an
		  additional lap and take the remaining laps of our car (perhaps the leader will
		  have an accident). If the amount of fuel we need is bigger than the tank, we
		  cut the amount with the second expression in the MIN statement. Because we
		  perhaps stopped in the pit to repair damage, the needed amount of fuel can
		  become negative. For that is the surrounding MAX statement.
		</p>

		<h3>The getRepair Method</h3>

		<p>
		  Computes the damage points to repair. A the moment we simply repair the whole
		  damage. This is on short races really braindead... so improve that.
		</p>

<p><pre class="lcolor">/* Computes how much damage to repair */
int Pit::getRepair()
{
    return car-&gt;_dammage;
}</pre></p>

		<h3>The Makefile</h3>

		<p>
		  We have now finished pit.cpp. To check if everything is in place, we add it in
		  the Makefile. Of course it will still do nothing, because we do not instantiate
		  the pit in our driver yet. This will be the last step. Now change in the Makefile
		  the line
		</p>

		<p><pre class="lbcolor">SOURCES     = ${ROBOT}.cpp driver.cpp opponent.cpp spline.cpp</pre></p>

		<p>
		  to
		</p>
		<p><pre class="lcolor">SOURCES     = ${ROBOT}.cpp driver.cpp opponent.cpp spline.cpp pit.cpp</pre></p>
