        <h3>Braking Distance</h3>
        <p>
          <img id="pic1" src="images/basic2.jpg" alt="brake distance formulas" border="0"></img>
          Like you have seen in the previous section, there is a physical speed limit in the turns.
          Imagine the following situation: we drive on a straight with speed v1, and in distance d is a turn.
          We can compute the possible speed (we call it v2) in the turn with the getAllowedSpeed() method,
          which we have developed in the previous chapter. If we make some assumptions, we can compute the
          required minimal braking distance s. Now if s is greater or equal than d we have to start braking
          (you see we brake as late as possible, and even a bit later).<br/>
          But how do we compute this distance? Look a the top formula on the sketch. This time we work with
          energy equations. Our car has a certain amount of kinetic energy, and we want to reach a lower
          energy state. We have to "burn" the energy difference in our brakes. You can solve the equation for
          s, which is our braking distance. We assume in this equation, that mu is constant over s, what is
          actually wrong e. g. at mixed tracks. But don't worry, it will work quite well anyway, but here is
          room for improvement.<br/>
          There is a special case of the formula, where v2 equals zero. We need that to compute the maximum
          braking distance. The idea is that in the worst case we have to stop, so checking this distance
          is sufficient.

        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        <p>
          Here is the code that computes if we need to brake.
        </p>
        <p>
          <pre class="lcolor">float Driver::getBrake(tCarElt* car)
{
    tTrackSeg *segptr = car-&gt;_trkPos.seg;
    float currentspeedsqr = car-&gt;_speed_x*car-&gt;_speed_x;
    float mu = segptr-&gt;surface-&gt;kFriction;
    float maxlookaheaddist = currentspeedsqr/(2.0*mu*G);</pre>
        </p>
        <p>maxlookaheddist is the distance we have to check (formula with special case v2 = 0).</p>
        <p>
          <pre class="lcolor">    float lookaheaddist = getDistToSegEnd(car);</pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          lookaheaddist holds the distance we have already checked. First we check if we need to brake for
          a speed limit on the end of the current segment.
        </p>
        <p>
          <pre class="lcolor">    float allowedspeed = getAllowedSpeed(segptr);
    if (allowedspeed &lt; car-&gt;_speed_x) return 1.0;</pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          Compute the allowed speed on the current segment. We check our speed, and if we are too fast we
          brake, else we continue with the algorithm. Here you can improve the return value, it's a bit tough
          to brake full (e. g. make it dependent on the speed difference).
        </p>
        <p>
          <pre class="lcolor">    segptr = segptr->next;
    while (lookaheaddist &lt; maxlookaheaddist) {</pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          The first line moves segptr to the next segment. The guard of the loop checks if we have already
          checked far enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          <pre class="lcolor">        allowedspeed = getAllowedSpeed(segptr);
        if (allowedspeed &lt; car-&gt;_speed_x) {</pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          Compute the allowed speed on the *segptr segment. If the allowed speed is smaller than the current
          speed, we need to investigate further.
        </p>
        <p>
          <pre class="lcolor">            float allowedspeedsqr = allowedspeed*allowedspeed;
            float brakedist = (currentspeedsqr - allowedspeedsqr) / (2.0*mu*G);</pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          Here we compute the braking distance according to the formula above.
        </p>
        <p>
          <pre class="lcolor">            if (brakedist &gt; lookaheaddist) {</pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          Here the magic check is done. If the required distance to brake is greater than the current distance
          we need to brake. This works because the simulation timestep is small, so we fail the point in the
          worst case with ~2.0 meters. So to fix that you can add always 2 meters to the brakedist, or better
          a speed dependent value.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          <pre class="lcolor">                return 1.0;
            }
        }
        lookaheaddist += segptr-&gt;length;
        segptr = segptr-&gt;next;
    }
    return 0.0;
}</pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          The remaining code is straightforward. If we decided to brake we return 1. If we loop further we update the
          lookaheaddist and switch to the next segment. A comment to the return value: 1 means apply full
          brakes, so we have later to adjust the pressure in the brake system, that the wheels don't lock up
          immediately or we have enough pressure at all. You will see this on the xj-220,
          the wheels will smoke very nice... A hint: it should also be possible to compute the right
          pressure and do an automatic set up of that value.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now we need also to change the drive method to call getAccel and getBrake.
        </p>
        <pre class="lcolor">        car-&gt;ctrl.gear = 4;
        car-&gt;ctrl.brakeCmd = getBrake(car);
        if (car-&gt;ctrl.brakeCmd == 0.0) {
            car-&gt;ctrl.accelCmd = getAccel(car);
        } else {
            car-&gt;ctrl.accelCmd = 0.0;
        }</pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          We have to switch into a higher gear to check the stuff. We just accelerate if we don't brake. And
          finally you need to update driver.h with the interface of getBrake.
        </p>
        </p>
        <pre class="lcolor">        float getBrake(tCarElt* car);</pre>
        </p>

        <h3>Testdrive</h3>
        <p>
          Do some test runs with the different cars. Enable the debug vector (press "g") to watch the return
          values of the robot. With cg-nascar-rwd you should recognize that the braking is very "flashy" on
          high speeds, try to explain why. The lap times are now:
