        <h1>3.1 Basic Utility Functions</h1>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          Ah, it's you. Welcome back. The boring "administrative" stuff is over, now we start to bang out the most out of our car.
          This chapter will introduce you in braking and gear changing. We will still drive on the middle of
          the track, so don't expect exciting lap times. But what braking concerns, you will implement in
          this chapter all "secrets" from my berniw robot. But before we start let's record some lap
          times of our current implementation with the cg-nascar-rwd car:
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type:disk; color:black;">
          <li>mixed-2: 1:24:24, 13314 damage.</li>
          <li>e-track-2: 2:18:76, 201 damage.</li>
          <li>e-track-4: 4:51:75, 4 damage.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In the "Basic" sections of this chapter I will introduce you into driving without considering
          aerodynamics, anti wheel locking and traction control. In the "Advanced" sections we will add
          this features. First we start with developing some useful utility functions.
        </p>

        <h3>About Speed Limits</h3>
        <p>
          <img id="pic1" src="images/basic1.jpg" alt="speed formula" border="0"></img>
          Of course, all speed junkies get now sick because of the section title. But keep in mind, if you
          want to race, use TORCS or go to the race track, please don't use public roads. But that's not
          the subject, I want to discuss the physical speed limits...<br/>
          Like you know from experience, you can't pass a turn with any speed, there are limits which can be
          described with physical laws. Of course we need to know how fast we can pass a turn. The force that 
          pushes the car outside
          the turn is called centrifugal force. That's the left part of the top equation on the sketch. To hold
          the car on the track, we need to compensate it. Our tires will do that job with friction on the
          track. The maximum possible speed in a turn results if you solve the equation. You should notice that we
          assume that all wheels have the same mu
          and the load is equally distributed over all wheels. We further simplify with the friction
          coefficient mu, in reality it's a complex function which depends on the relative speed vector
          between the surfaces, the current load, the shape of the patch, the temperature, ... This leads to
          the following function:
        </p>

  <table class="maincontent">
    <tr>
      <td class="maincontent">

        <p>
          <pre class="lcolor">/* Compute the allowed speed on a segment */
float Driver::getAllowedSpeed(tTrackSeg *segment)
{
    if (segment-&gt;type == TR_STR) {
        return FLT_MAX;
    } else {
        float mu = segment-&gt;surface-&gt;kFriction;
        return sqrt(mu*G*segment-&gt;radius);
    }
}</pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          The function gets a pointer to the segment in question. If it's a straight segment there is no limit,
          else we compute the limit according to the above formula. You can improve the function e. g. with
          taking into account the center of gravity of the car.
        </p>

        <h3>Distance</h3>
        <p>
          For braking we need also to know distances. Here is a function that computes the distance of the car
          to the end of the current segment (remember the track segments or look up chapter 1.3). I put this into a function, because car->_trkPos.toStart contains
          depending on the segment type the arc or the length, so we need to convert it sometimes to the length
          (arc times radius = length).
        </p>
        <p>
          <pre class="lcolor">/* Compute the length to the end of the segment */
float Driver::getDistToSegEnd(tCarElt* car)
{
    if (car-&gt;_trkPos.seg-&gt;type == TR_STR) {
        return car-&gt;_trkPos.seg-&gt;length - car-&gt;_trkPos.toStart;
    } else {
        return (car-&gt;_trkPos.seg-&gt;arc - car-&gt;_trkPos.toStart)*car-&gt;_trkPos.seg-&gt;radius;
    }
}</pre>
        </p>

        <h3>Accelerator</h3>
        <p>
          We need also to know for a given speed how much accelerator pedal we have to apply. If we tell TORCS
          to accelerate 100% (1.0), it tries to run the engine at the maximum allowed rpm (car->_enginerpmRedLine). We can
          compute the angular speed of the wheel with the speed and the wheel radius. This has to be equal like
          the desired rpm divided by the gear ratio. So we finally end up with an equation for the desired rpm,
          the pedal value is then rpm/enginerpmRedLine. If the given speed is much higher than the current speed, we will
          accelerate full.
        </p>
        <p>
          <pre class="lcolor">/* Compute fitting acceleration */
float Driver::getAccel(tCarElt* car)
{
    float allowedspeed = getAllowedSpeed(car-&gt;_trkPos.seg);
    float gr = car-&gt;_gearRatio[car-&gt;_gear + car-&gt;_gearOffset];
    float rm = car-&gt;_enginerpmRedLine;
    if (allowedspeed &gt; car-&gt;_speed_x + FULL_ACCEL_MARGIN) {
        return 1.0;
    } else {
        return allowedspeed/car-&gt;_wheelRadius(REAR_RGT)*gr /rm;
    }
}</pre>
        </p>

        <h3>Finishing Implementation</h3>
        <p>
          We have to define the constants G and FULL_ACCEL_MARGIN in driver.cpp
        </p>
        <p>
          <pre class="lcolor">const float Driver::G = 9.81;                  /* [m/(s*s)] */
const float Driver::FULL_ACCEL_MARGIN = 1.0;   /* [m/s] */</pre></p>
        <p>
          and in driver.h.
        </p>
          <pre class="lcolor">static const float G;
static const float FULL_ACCEL_MARGIN;</pre></p>
        <p>
          Put also the above method interfaces into driver.h.
        </p>
          <pre class="lcolor">float getAllowedSpeed(tTrackSeg *segment);
float getAccel(tCarElt* car);
float getDistToSegEnd(tCarElt* car);</pre>
        </p>
