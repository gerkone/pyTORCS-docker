        <h1>3.5 Advanced Braking</h1>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          This section is about braking with aerodynamic forces. Because we have aerodynamic
          downforce and drag we will be able to brake later. That was also the reason of the brake
          "flickering" on high speeds. Because more energy is absorbed than we expect, we reach the
          goal speed too early, so we stop braking. A moment later we are again too fast, and need to
          brake again, and so on... Don't run away because of the scary
          formulas, they are not too hard to understand.
        </p>

        <h3>Braking Distance</h3>
        <p>
          <img id="pic1" src="images/advanced2.jpg" alt="brake distance formulas" border="0"></img>
          Let's have a look at this funny equation. You already know the first three terms on the
          left from section 3.2 ("brakes 1"). We still have to burn the energy difference in the
          brakes. The second term from the right describes the additional energy we can "burn" in
          the brakes caused by the downforce which acts on the wheels.
          Because the speed changes over the braking distance I formulate it with an integral.

          <img id="pic2" src="images/advanced3.jpg" alt="brake distance formulas" border="0"></img>
          The rightmost term describes the
          energy which is used by the drag. The drag is like the downforce a function of the squared
          speed, so we also need an integral.
          Because I had no idea how to solve this equation for
          s (=s2-s1, so one could also put the first term on the right into an integral), I will present
          an approximation. Meanwhile I found the <a href="./braking3.html">optimal solution</a>.<br/>
          Like you can see on the left sketch, I make a bad guess for the area
          of the integral. I simply take the rectangle with the size v2^2*s, which will be always too
          small. That's exactly how it works in the berniw robot. You can improve that by inserting
          some velocities and integrate numerically over more steps.
          Now we put this easy expression into the top formula. We will find an upper bound
          for the braking distance s. Doesn't look dangerous anymore, doesn't it?

        <h3>Computing Drag Coefficient CW</h3>
        <p>
          You can see that we need to compute an additional coefficient. It's quite similar to the
          computation of the wingca in initCa(...), so here it is, put it in driver.cpp:
        </p>
        <p><pre class="lcolor">/* Compute aerodynamic drag coefficient CW */
void Driver::initCw()
{
    float cx = GfParmGetNum(car-&gt;_carHandle, SECT_AERODYNAMICS,
                            PRM_CX, (char*) NULL, 0.0);
    float frontarea = GfParmGetNum(car-&gt;_carHandle, SECT_AERODYNAMICS,
                                   PRM_FRNTAREA, (char*) NULL, 0.0);
    CW = 0.645*cx*frontarea;
}</pre></p>

        <p>
          You need to define initCw() and CW also in driver.h:
        </p>
        <p><pre class="lcolor">    void initCw();
    float CW;      /* aerodynamic drag coefficient */</pre>
        </p>

        <p>
          Add the call of initCw() at the end of newRace(...) in driver.cpp:
        </p>
        <p><pre class="lcolor">    initCw();</pre>
        </p>

        <h3>Implementing the new Formula</h3>
        <p>
          Replace the following line in getBrake(), driver.cpp
        </p>
        <p><pre  class="lbcolor">    float brakedist = (currentspeedsqr - allowedspeedsqr) / (2.0*mu*G);</pre></p>
        <p>
          with
        </p>
        <p><pre class="lcolor">    float brakedist = mass*(currentspeedsqr - allowedspeedsqr) /
                      (2.0*(mu*G*mass + allowedspeedsqr*(CA*mu + CW)));</pre></p>

        <h3>Take a Ride</h3>
        <p>
          <img id="pic4" src="images/advanced5.jpg" alt="brake distance analysis" border="0"></img>
          This time the improvement is small, on e-track-4 we win around one second. It's because
          our formula works only well for small speed differences at high speeds. If you want better
          results you need to split the range of [v1..v2] into more intervals or implement the
          <a href="./braking3.html">analytic solution</a>. The left picture shows braking from 80 [m/s] down to
          40 [m/s] and the braking distances computed with the old method (black), the new method
          (green) and an
          almost perfect integrated solution (blue). You can get good results already with 5 intervals.
          You could also try to implement Romberg integration.<br/>
          The "perfect" curve looks like a straight line in this plot. If we would brake from 30 [m/s]
          to 5 [m/s] this wouldn't be the case anymore.
