# Driver

The **_driver_** is made up of two components:
* **torcs_client** is the compatibility client that allows for TORCS abstraction.
* **agents** is the folder designated to contain the autonomous agents

The agents should then be used following [this guide](https://github.com/gerkone/torcs_test/tree/master/driver).
