# Driver

The **_driver_** is made up of two components:
* **torcs_client** is the compatibility client that allows for TORCS abstraction.
* **agents** is the folder designated to contain the autonomous agents

To use the environment with your custom run file or use it standalone follow [this guide](https://github.com/gerkone/pyTORCS-docker/tree/master/driver/torcs_client).
