directories have special licenses, have a look at them. The rest of the
distribution is licensed according the GPL and the Free Art License.

TORCS Requirements

You need at least a 600MHz CPU (800MHz recommended), 128 MB RAM (256MB
recommended) and an OpenGL 1.3 capable graphics card with 32MB RAM (64MB
recommended). Make sure that you have installed the latest sound and
graphics drivers.

  (http://torcs.sourceforge.net/index.php?name=Sections&op=viewarticle&artid=10).
- Press F1 anytime to get help (do it as well during the ride to learn about
  the options).

Getting Help
------------
First have a look at the available documentation on www.torcs.org and

For the player driver, the car parameters are located in the files
"drivers/human/car*.xml" depending on the car used. You can
change them with a text editor, for more information look into the

is automatically installed if you select to install the "developer
