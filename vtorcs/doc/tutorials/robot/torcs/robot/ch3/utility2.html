        <h1>3.4 Advanced Utility Functions</h1>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          Here we have a look on aerodynamic downforce of cars and increase the speed
          in the turns. Optionally you can slim down the interfaces of some methods.
        </p>

        <h3>Speed Limit with Aerodynamics</h3>
        <p>
          <img id="pic1" src="images/advanced1.jpg" alt="advanced speed formula" border="0"></img>
          In the "utility 1" section I showed you the equation for the speed limit in turns without
          aerodynamics. We now add on the right side a term for the contribution of the aerodynamic
          downforce. You can see that the value of this term rises proportional to the square of the
          speed (look up the Bernoulli-equation in a physics book). The coefficient "ca" depends
          on properties like the density of air, the area,
          shape and angle of attack of the spoilers (also called wings) and the distance from the
          car bottom to the track (called "ride height"). The spoilers work like wings from an
          airplane which are mounted upside down. The effect between the cars bottom and the track is
          called "ground effect" and produces also downforce.<br/>
          This doesn't apply to normal cars, because they don't have big spoilers nor specially for
          downforce designed chassis. The sign of the rightmost term is then negative and
          the force on the wheels is reduced proportional to the square of the speed... be careful!<br/>
          We solve again the equation for the speed. There are now two unpleasant effects. First the
          mass of the car doesn't cancel out anymore in the equation. Second, if r*ca*mu/m becomes
          greater than one we get a complex number as result... is the above formula wrong? In fact it is
          correct if we restrict the domain and range. Look at the formula as v=f(r). So v can range
          from 0..infinity and the domain of r is 0 &le; r &le; m/(ca*mu), because if r is greater
          we can drive trough the turn with any speed. We implement this restriction with the
          MIN(1.0, r*ca*mu/m) term. Now modify in driver.cpp the
          getAllowedSpeed(...) method. Change the line

        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
          Next we have to implement the computation of CA and the mass of the car.
        </p>

        <h3>Downforce Coefficient CA</h3>
        <p>
          Here I show you how to compute the coefficient CA. I won't explain the formulas, look up a
          book about fluid dynamics. Because CA includes just static properties, we need to compute it
          just once. Put this method into driver.cpp.
        </p>
        <p>
          <pre class="lcolor">/* Compute aerodynamic downforce coefficient CA */
void Driver::initCa()
{
    char *WheelSect[4] = {SECT_FRNTRGTWHEEL, SECT_FRNTLFTWHEEL,
                          SECT_REARRGTWHEEL, SECT_REARLFTWHEEL};
    float rearwingarea = GfParmGetNum(car-&gt;_carHandle, SECT_REARWING,
                                       PRM_WINGAREA, (char*) NULL, 0.0);
    float rearwingangle = GfParmGetNum(car-&gt;_carHandle, SECT_REARWING,
                                        PRM_WINGANGLE, (char*) NULL, 0.0);
    float wingca = 1.23*rearwingarea*sin(rearwingangle);</pre>

        </p>
        <p>
          First we declare an array with the wheel section names. These addresses sections in an XML file,
          where all car properties are specified. All the possible sections and properties are defined
          in car.h.
          Next we read two numeric properties from the XML file, the area of the rear wing and the angle
          of attack. Based on that and the density of air ([kg/m^3]) we compute the ca of the rear wing.
          You could also compute and add the contribution of the front wing.
        </p>
        <p>
          <pre class="lcolor">    float cl = GfParmGetNum(car-&gt;_carHandle, SECT_AERODYNAMICS,
                             PRM_FCL, (char*) NULL, 0.0) +
                GfParmGetNum(car-&gt;_carHandle, SECT_AERODYNAMICS,
                             PRM_RCL, (char*) NULL, 0.0);
    float h = 0.0;
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++)
        h += GfParmGetNum(car-&gt;_carHandle, WheelSect[i],
                          PRM_RIDEHEIGHT, (char*) NULL, 0.20);
    h*= 1.5; h = h*h; h = h*h; h = 2.0 * exp(-3.0*h);
    CA = h*cl + 4.0*wingca;
}</pre>
        <p>
          Next we read the "ground effect" coefficients for the car front and rear. We sum them up in cl.
          Improvements are possible with considering front and rear separately and take into account just
          the minimum. In the for loop we compute the effect of the distance of the cars floor to the
          track (called "ride height"). Finally we compute CA and store it. For simplicity we assume
          that the ride height is constant (it's obviously not because of the springs). The numerical
          constants above appear just in this computation, so I don't assign nice names.
        </p>
        </p>

        <h3>Mass</h3>
        <p>
          The total current mass of the car consists of the cars mass (constant) and the mass of the
          fuel. Because we burn fuel, the current car mass changes over time and can differ up to 10%.
          This is significant,
          so we need to update it from time to time. For simplicity we implement update in every
          timestep. In car-&gt;_fuel we find the remaining fuel (in [kg]), the car mass is specified
          in the XML file.
        </p>

        <h3>Finishing Implementation</h3>
        <p>
          We put the initialization of CA and the car mass into newRace(...), file driver.cpp:
        </p>
        <p>
          <pre class="lcolor">    this-&gt;car = car;
    CARMASS = GfParmGetNum(car-&gt;_carHandle, SECT_CAR, PRM_MASS, NULL, 1000.0);
    initCa();</pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          You see that we store now the car pointer, so we don't need to pass it on successive calls.
          Now we add the mass update to update(...) in driver.cpp:
        </p>
        <p>
          <pre class="lcolor">    mass = CARMASS + car-&gt;_fuel;</pre></p>
        <p>
        <p>
          Remove the car parameter from the following methods (in driver.cpp, driver.h) and fix all
          calls (in driver.cpp, <span style="color:red;">bt</span>.cpp).
        </p>
        <p>
          <pre>drive(tCarElt* car, tSituation *s) -&gt drive(tSituation *s)
pitCommand(tCarElt* car, tSituation *s) -&gt pitCommand(tSituation *s)
isStuck(tCarElt* car) -&gt isStuck()
update(tCarElt* car, tSituation *s) -&gt update(tSituation *s)
getBrake(tCarElt* car) -&gt getBrake()
getAccel(tCarElt* car) -&gt getAccel()
getDistToSegEnd(tCarElt* car) -&gt getDistToSegEnd()
getGear(tCarElt *car) -&gt getGear()
endRace(tCarElt *car, tSituation *s) -&gt; endRace(tSituation *s)</pre></p>
        <p>
        <p>
          We have to define initCa() in driver.h:
        </p>
        <p>
          <pre class="lcolor">    void initCa();</pre></p>
        <p>
        <p>
          and also the new variables:
        </p>
        <p>
          <pre class="lcolor">    float mass;        /* mass of car + fuel */
    tCarElt *car;      /* pointer to tCarElt struct */
    float CARMASS;     /* mass of the car only */
    float CA;          /* aerodynamic downforce coefficient */</pre>
        </p>

        <h3>Lap Times</h3>
        <p>
          Implement the above stuff and do some test runs. Because we go more and more to the limit,
          our robot is suffering from the very bad steering function and path on the
          track. Just e-track-4 is completed well (from the tracks below) with a gain of ~14 seconds.

        <p>
          <img id="pic2" src="images/oldvsnew.jpg" alt="speed graphs" border="0"></img>
          To estimate what we can expect from the new getAllowedSpeed(...) method I present you this plot. It is
          for a cg-nascar-rwd with full fuel tank on the track wheel-1. The mass is 1250 [kg], mu is 1.2 [-],
          CA is 2.61 [kg/m] and G is 9,81 [m/(s*s)]. The green curve is the new speed for a given radius,
          the blue curve the old speed. One can see very nice that our new implementation has always
          an advantage and that there are significant improvments. Especially on wide turns we can drive
          up to ~130% of the previous speed.
