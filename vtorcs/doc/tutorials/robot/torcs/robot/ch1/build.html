        <h1>1.2 Build the Robot</h1>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          So, you want to build your robot? Ok, here is some basic information about that. As you know
          from the installation section, everything is already set up fine (remember the test compilation
          of tanhoj). The directory where your robots sources are is $TORCS_BASE/src/drivers/<span style="color:red;">bt</span>. To build
          your robot you will use "make". Make is a powerful tool which will track dependencies for you and
          much more. But don't worry, everything is already set up.<br/>
          You will recognise that we have to do stuff in more than one directory, so it makes sense to use
          more than one shell. I use the Konsole from KDE and have one shell for every directory.
        </p>
          <ul style="list-style-type:disk; color:black;">
           <li>/usr/local/share/games/torcs to run TORCS and look up if the installation worked.</li>
           <li>$TORCS_BASE/src/drivers/<span style="color:red;">bt</span> to work on the robot.</li>
           <li>$TORCS_BASE/export/include/ to search in the header files.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I would suggest using an editor which supports at least syntax highlighting, easy to use are nedit
          and kate (choose C++ mode). I prefer kate.
        </p>

        <h3>Compile and Install Your Robot</h3>
        <p>
          <tt>
            $ cd $TORCS_BASE/src/drivers/<span style="color:red;">bt</span><br/>
            $ make<br/>
          </tt>
        </p>

        <p>
          It should now be compiled. If you get errors, check the installation and the environment variables.
          If everything worked fine install your robot with
        </p>
        <p>
          <tt>
            $ make install<br/>
          </tt>
        </p>
        <p>
          In case you get errors here check if the compilation worked and if the permissions are correct
          in /usr/local/share/games/torcs. If everything worked fine, start TORCS and choose practice, choose your robot
          and start a practice session. Here it is and stays and stays and... Cool!<br/>
        </p>
