          Hi. In case you are looking for Celtic Torcs then this is the wrong place, as you can guess from the
          screenshot on the left. But some entertainment and fun is also good for you, so you are welcome to
          stay with me and read on.<br/>
          In a nutshell, <a href="http://torcs.org" target="_parent">TORCS</a>, <b>The Open Racing Car Simulator</b>
          is a car racing simulation,
          which allows you to
          drive in races against oppenents simulated by the computer.
          But that's not the whole story.

          When you become bored by driving yourself,
          you can develop your own computer-controlled driver (also called a robot) in C or C++.
          This site will teach you how to get, compile, install and run TORCS within Linux, and finally how to start the
          development of your own driver. Compile, you may ask! Yes, TORCS is "Open Source" (GNU General
          Public License Version 2), so you get all the sources for free. In case you just want to race you can
          also download and install binaries. This site is aimed toward robot development with Linux.
        </p>

        <h2>Features</h2>

          </a>
          Choose from 42 different cars, 30 tracks, more than 50 opponents to race against. Steer with
          a joystick or steering wheel, if it's supported by your platform. It is also possible to drive with
          the mouse or the keyboard, but it's not easy. Graphic features lighting, smoke, skidmarks and glowing brake
          disks. The simulation features a simple damage model, collisions, tire and wheel properties
          (springs, dampers, stiffness, ...), aerodynamics (ground effect, spoilers, ...) and much more.
		  The gameplay allows different types of races from the simple practice session up to the championship.
		  Enjoy racing against your friends in the split screen mode with up to four human players.
