# Certain portions of the Autoconf source text are designed to be copied

# source text consists of comments plus executable code that decides which

# comments and executable code the "non-data" portions.  Autoconf never
# copies any of the non-data portions into its output.

# This special exception to the GPL applies to versions of Autoconf
# released by the Free Software Foundation.  When you make and
# distribute a modified version of Autoconf, you may extend this special
# exception to the GPL to apply to your modified version as well, *unless*
# your modified version has the potential to copy into its output some
# of the text that was the non-data portion of the version that you started
# with.  (In other words, unless your change moves or copies text from
# the non-data portions to the data portions.)  If your modification has
# such potential, you must delete any notice of this special exception
# to the GPL from your modified version.
